  - **ELECTRA** - More efficient pre-training for discriminative models

#### Hybrid Model Architecture
- Create an ensemble of specialized models:
  - URL analysis model (focused on detecting malicious links)
  - Content analysis model (focused on phishing language patterns)
  - Sender analysis model (focused on sender reputation and authentication)
  - Combine results using a meta-learner for final classification

### 2. Real-time Threat Intelligence Integration

#### External Threat Feeds
- Integrate with commercial and open-source threat intelligence feeds:
  - PhishTank API for known phishing URLs

- Context-aware analysis based on user role and department

#### Organizational Communication Graph
- Map communication patterns within organizations
- Detect unusual communication flows that might indicate account compromise
- Identify targeted spear-phishing attempts based on organizational structure

### 4. Enhanced Visual Analysis

#### Advanced Logo Detection
- Train custom computer vision models to detect brand logos in emails
- Compare with legitimate brand visual identity to detect subtle manipulations
- Identify pixel-level modifications designed to bypass traditional filters

#### Screenshot Analysis
- Detect phishing attempts that use screenshots of legitimate content
- OCR processing to extract and analyze text from images
- Detect image-based evasion techniques

### 5. Multimodal Analysis

#### Cross-Modal Feature Fusion
- Combine text, image, and metadata features in a unified model
- Use attention mechanisms to focus on the most suspicious elements
- Implement cross-modal transformers for better feature integration

#### Document Analysis
- Analyze attachments for malicious content, macros, and scripts
- Detect document-based social engineering techniques
- Sandbox execution for suspicious attachments

### 6. Explainable AI and Interactive Learning

#### Human-in-the-Loop Learning
- Allow security teams to provide feedback on detection results
- Implement active learning to prioritize uncertain cases for human review
- Continuously update models based on expert feedback

#### Explainable Detections
- Provide detailed explanations for why an email was flagged
- Visualize the specific elements that triggered detection
- Confidence scores for different detection components

### 7. Adversarial Resilience

#### Adversarial Training
- Train models using adversarial examples to improve robustness
- Implement techniques to detect adversarial evasion attempts
- Regular red-team exercises to identify weaknesses

#### Prompt Injection Defense
- Detect and mitigate LLM prompt injection attacks
